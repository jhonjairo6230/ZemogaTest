# Zemoga Test
## Backend
This project is the solution to the Zemoga Nodejs Backend challenge, here you will find two folders `Backend` and `FrontEnd` in the Backend folder you will find a backend solution based in serverless framework and AWS Lambda, you can read more about that in:

- Serverless: https://www.serverless.com/
- AWS Lambda: https://aws.amazon.com/es/lambda/features/

Here I decided use mvc software architecture mode because it's scalable light an easy to implement, for this reason I created this project structure:
